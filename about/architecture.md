## Overview

**Clockwork threads are powered by a subnet of RPC nodes called the "workernet" (or "workers").** The nodes on the workernet are running a special plugin that allows them to simulate threads, pack instructions, and submit transactions to the chain on your programs behalf.&#x20;

\
The Clockwork automation engine has two primary subsystem:

1. A **smart-contract** where users can create transaction queues.
2. A **worker network** where Solana node operators can crank queues and collect automation fees as yield.

These two layers work together to power automations for other programs. At a network level, Clockwork is unique in that every worker is a Solana validator or RPC node under the hood. Since the entire worker network runs on the same physical servers that already power the Solana blockchain, Clockwork is generally more reliable, less spammy, and cheaper than traditional SaaS-based alternatives.
