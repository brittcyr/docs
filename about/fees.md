# Fees

**Fees are a cost, paid by users for the automation services provided by the worker network.** Without fees, the worker network would have no incentive to process automated transactions.

## Flat rate

The automation fee is currently set to a flat rate of **0.000001 SOL / crank**. This value is managed by the core Clockwork team and subject to change with future price discovery. Longterm, we plan to migrate fees to either a DAO-controlled or market-based pricing mechanism.
