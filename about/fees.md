# Fees

**Fees are a cost, paid by users for automation services provided by the worker network.** Without fees, the worker network would have no incentive to process automated transactions. The automation fee is currently set to a minimum of **0.000001 SOL / instruction**. Thread owners may set a higher fee on their thread to prioritize their thread with block builders.&#x20;
