# Fees

## Free





All queues must maintain a sufficient balance of SOL to pay workers for their services. The automation fee is currently set to a flat rate of **1000 lamports / crank** (1 one millionth of a SOL) and managed by the core Clockwork team. This value is subject to change with future price discovery and long-term may transition to a DAO-controlled or market-based mechanism.
