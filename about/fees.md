# Fees

**Fees are a cost, paid by users for the automation services provided by the worker network.** Without fees, the worker network would have no incentive to allocate compute resources towards cranking users' transaction queues.

## Balance

The automation fee is currently set to a flat rate of **1000 lamports / crank** (1 one millionth of a SOL). This value is managed by the core Clockwork team and subject to change with future price discovery. Long-term, we aim to make pricing to a DAO-controlled or market-based mechanism.
