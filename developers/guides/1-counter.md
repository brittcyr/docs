A complete copy of all code provided in this guide can be found in the [Clockwork examples repository](https://github.com/clockwork-xyz/examples/tree/main/counter).
{% endhint %}

## Goals

In the [previous guide](https://docs.clockwork.xyz/developers/guides/you-first-automation-hello-clockwork), we learned how to automate a Solana program with the Clockwork [Typescript SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@clockwork-xyz/sdk). We did so by submitting transactions on-chain to the Solana RPC. In this guide, we will see how your program can also create **Threads** by doing [CPIs](https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/calling-between-programs#cross-program-invocations) with the [Clockwork Thread Program](https://docs.rs/clockwork-thread-program/latest/clockwork\_thread\_program/).

## Use Cases

* You want a program to be the thread admin and decide when the thread should execute, start, stop, etc.
* You don't want an individual wallet to keep control of the Thread behavior.

## 1. Our starter project

```bash
anchor init counter
cd counter
```

Now let's open up the program file located at `programs/counter/src/lib.rs`:

1. `struct Counter` ‚Äì We start by defining an account `Counter` to hold our counter state.
2. `fn increment()` ‚Äì We declare an instruction to mutate that Counter.
3. `struct Increment<'info>` ‚Äì We declare an [Anchor validation struct](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/the-accounts-struct) to express constraints on that `increment` instruction.

```rust
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;

// 1Ô∏è‚É£ We define an account to hold our counter state
#[account]
pub struct Counter {
    pub current_value: u64, // the value of the counter
    pub updated_at: i64,    // last time the counter has been updated
}

#[program]
pub mod counter {
    use super::*;
    
    // 2Ô∏è‚É£ We define an instruction to mutate the `Counter`
    pub fn increment(ctx: Context<Increment>) -> Result<()> {    
        ctx.accounts.counter.current_value = ctx.accounts.counter.current_value.checked_add(1).unwrap();
        ctx.accounts.counter.updated_at = Clock::get().unwrap().unix_timestamp;
        Ok(())
    }
}

/// Seed for `Counter` account Program Derived Address
/// ‚ö† Make sure it matches whatever you are using on the client-side
pub const SEED_COUNTER: &[u8] = b"counter";

// 3Ô∏è‚É£ We define constraints for the `increment` instruction with Anchor macros
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Increment<'info> {
    #[account(mut)]
    pub payer: Signer<'info>,
    
    #[account(address = system_program::ID)]
    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,

    #[account(
        init_if_needed,
        payer = payer,
        seeds = [SEED_COUNTER],
        bump,
        space = 8 + std::mem::size_of::<Counter>(),
    )]
    pub counter: Account<'info, Counter>,    
}
```

{% hint style="info" %}
The key point here is that the counter account's authority is a program. We will see later on why it is important to use a PDA instead of a wallet as an authority.
{% endhint %}

## 2. The Clockwork thread program

In the previous guide, we created threads using the Typescript SDK. In Solana, everything is an account and threads are no different. We were just asking the Clockwork thread program to create thread accounts for us. Similar to the Token Program maintained by the Solana team, the Clockwork Thread Program is a program deployed and maintained by the clockwork team.

So instead of submitting transactions to the RPC, we can very well interact with that program using CPIs. Here's an example of instructions provided by the [Thread Program](https://docs.rs/clockwork-sdk/latest/clockwork\_sdk/cpi/index.html) via the [Clockwork-SDK](https://crates.io/crates/clockwork-sdk) for programs.

* ``[`thread_create`](https://docs.rs/clockwork-sdk/latest/clockwork\_sdk/cpi/fn.thread\_create.html) ‚Äì Create a Thread with a target instruction to run.
* ``[`thread_delete`](https://docs.rs/clockwork-sdk/latest/clockwork\_sdk/cpi/fn.thread\_delete.html) ‚Äì  Delete a Thread and withdraw the funds.
* ``[`thread_pause`](https://docs.rs/clockwork-sdk/latest/clockwork\_sdk/cpi/fn.thread\_pause.html) ‚Äì Pause a Thread execution.
* ``[`thread_resume`](https://docs.rs/clockwork-sdk/latest/clockwork\_sdk/cpi/fn.thread\_resume.html) ‚Äì Resume a Thread execution.
* ``[`thread_update`](https://docs.rs/clockwork-sdk/latest/clockwork\_sdk/cpi/fn.thread\_update.html) ‚Äì Update a Thread settings; instructions, triggers, etc.

## 3. Creating a Clockwork Thread

We will take the increment counter instruction and instead of running it by ourselves, we create a thread and make it increment the counter on our behalf. Let's create that thread, instead of crafting the instructions by hand, let's install the [Rust Clockwork SDK](https://crates.io/crates/clockwork-sdk):

```bash
cargo add clockwork-sdk@~2.0.1
```

Let's head back to our program file located at `programs/counter/src/lib.rs`, what follows are the typical steps to create a thread via CPI:

1. `target_ix` ‚Äì We start by defining the instruction to run by our thread.
2. `trigger` ‚Äì We define the conditions for our thread to wake and execute.
3. `clockwork_sdk::cpi::thread_create` ‚Äì We use this helper to create thread CPI.

```rust
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;
use anchor_lang::InstructionData;
use anchor_lang::solana_program::{
    instruction::Instruction,
    native_token::LAMPORTS_PER_SOL,
    system_program
};
// 0Ô∏è‚É£ Import the clockwork_sdk crate
use clockwork_sdk::state::{ThreadAccount};

...

/// Seed for thread_authority pda
/// ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure it matches whatever you are using on the client-side
pub const THREAD_AUTHORITY_SEED: &[u8] = b"authority";

pub mod counter {
    ...
    pub fn increment(ctx: Context<Increment>) -> Result<()> { ... }
    
    pub fn create_thread(ctx: Context<CreateThread>, thread_id: Vec<u8>)
     -> Result<()> {
        // Get accounts
        let payer = &ctx.accounts.payer;
        let system_program = &ctx.accounts.system_program;
        let clockwork_program = &ctx.accounts.clockwork_program;
        let thread = &ctx.accounts.thread;
        let thread_authority = &ctx.accounts.thread_authority;
        let bump = *ctx.bumps.get("thread_authority").unwrap();
        let counter = &ctx.accounts.counter;
    
        // 1Ô∏è‚É£ Prepare an instruction to feed to the Thread
        let target_ix = Instruction {
            program_id: ID,
            accounts: crate::accounts::Increment {
                system_program: system_program.key(),
                payer: clockwork_sdk::utils::PAYER_PUBKEY, // üëà See note below
                counter: counter.key(),
            }.to_account_metas(Some(true)),
            data: crate::instruction::Increment {}.data(),
        };
    
        // 2Ô∏è‚É£ Define a trigger for the Thread to execute
        let trigger = clockwork_sdk::state::Trigger::Cron {
            schedule: "*/10 * * * * * *".into(),
            skippable: true,
        };
    
        // 3Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Thread via CPI
        clockwork_sdk::cpi::thread_create(
            CpiContext::new_with_signer(
                clockwork_program.to_account_info(),
                clockwork_sdk::cpi::ThreadCreate {
                    authority: thread_authority.to_account_info(),
                    payer: payer.to_account_info(),
                    system_program: system_program.to_account_info(),
                    thread: thread.to_account_info(),
                },
                &[&[THREAD_AUTHORITY_SEED, &[bump]]]
            ),
            2 * LAMPORTS_PER_SOL,       // Top-up the thread with this amount
            thread_id,                  // Id
            vec![target_ix.into()],     // Instructions vec
            trigger,                    // Trigger
        )?;
    
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Note the `clockwork_sdk::utils::PAYER_PUBKEY` this is essential for our thread to pay for the account created by the `increment` instruction and is explained in this [section](../threads/payers.md).
{% endhint %}

Finally, the trickiest part is to properly define our create thread instructions constraints with anchor macros:

```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
#[instruction(thread_id: Vec < u8 >)]
pub struct CreateThread<'info> {
    /// Who's paying for this CreateThread Transaction
    /// (not to be confused with the thread executions)
    #[account(mut)]
    pub payer: Signer<'info>,
    
    #[account(address = system_program::ID)]
    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,

    /// Clockwork Program (Thread Program)
    #[account(address = clockwork_sdk::ID)]
    pub clockwork_program: Program<'info, clockwork_sdk::ThreadProgram>,

    /// Address to assign to the newly created Thread
    #[account(
        mut,
        address = clockwork_sdk::state::Thread::pubkey(thread_authority.key(), thread_id)
    )]
    pub thread: SystemAccount<'info>,

    /// Thread Admin
    #[account(
        seeds = [THREAD_AUTHORITY_SEED],
        bump,
    )]
    pub thread_authority: SystemAccount<'info>,

    #[account(
        mut,
        seeds = [SEED_COUNTER],
        bump,
    )]
    pub counter: Account<'info, Counter>,
}
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that the thread [authority](../threads/authority.md) is a PDA account. Only this program has authority to administrate the thread; pause, start, create, delete the thread, etc.
{% endhint %}

Finally, here's what the client-side look like for our program:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```typescript
...
import { ClockworkProvider } from "@clockwork-xyz/sdk";

const clockworkProvider = new ClockworkProvider(wallet, provider.connection);

it("It increments every 10 seconds", async () => {    
    // 1Ô∏è‚É£ Prepare thread address
    const threadId = "counter";
    const [threadAuthority] = PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync(
        // Make sure it matches on the prog side
        [anchor.utils.bytes.utf8.encode("authority")], 
        program.programId
    );
    
    const [threadAddress, threadBump] = clockworkProvider.getThreadPDA(threadAuthority, threadId)
    
    // 2Ô∏è‚É£ Ask our program to create a thread via CPI
    // and thus become the admin of that thread
    await program.methods
        .createThread(Buffer.from(threadId))
        .accounts({
            systemProgram: SystemProgram.programId,
            clockworkProgram: clockworkProvider.threadProgram.programId,
            payer: wallet.publicKey,
            thread: threadAddress,
            threadAuthority: threadAuthority,
            counter: counter,
        })
        .rpc();
}
```
{% endcode %}

Clone the [completed project](https://github.com/clockwork-xyz/examples/tree/main/counter), and run the tests with `anchor test`; we can see that our counter account is now being incremented every 10 seconds by our thread:

## Key Learnings

* Use the [`PAYER_PUBKEY`](../threads/payers.md) address whenever you need to pay for new account initializations.
* User wallets cannot sign automated transactions. Instead, we can delegate token spending authority to a PDA and automate that account.
