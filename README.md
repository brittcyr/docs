# Introduction

**Clockwork** **is a decentralized automation network for** [**Solana**](https://solana.com/). Blockchain developers can use Clockwork to schedule transactions and automate on-chain programs without having to rely on dedicated servers.&#x20;

## **Background**

Blockchains represent a major paradigm shift in software engineering. Where traditional applications are hosted in large, centrally-managed datacenters, blockchains offer an alternative hosting environment run by a decentralized community of stakeholders. In the distributed runtime of a blockchain, program state is redundantly copied to thousands of nodes around the world, and program execution can happen on any node in the network.&#x20;

### Solana

**Solana is the most active blockchain in the world.** Its affordable fees, low-latency confirmation times, and scalable architecture make it an ideal choice for new users and developers entering the crypto ecosystem today. With over 40,000,000 non-vote transactions per day, Solana has more on-chain activity than every other notable blockchain combined. Powered by over 3,400 full-node validators ([**source**](https://solana.com/news/validator-health-report-august-2022)), Solana is additionally one of the most decentralized blockchains in the world.

### Decentralization

**Decentralization is core to everything we do in crypto.** It's the fundamental principle behind network security, censorship resistance, and permissionless computing. Despite the crypto industry's emphasis on "decentralization" as something novel, it's ironically a very old idea. In fact, the trade-off between centralized, authoritarian decision making and decentralized, group-based coordination has been a recurring debate in philosophy, economics, politics, and technology over the last few centuries.&#x20;

Decentralization was even a core value and property of the early Internet. Though in recent years, this has become much less true. Today, the vast majority of internet communications flow through a small handful of companies and infrastructure providers. In general, this centralization makes services across the internet less secure and more susceptible to censorship. When a network administrator can ban any user at will, true user autonomy and asset ownership are impossible.&#x20;

### The automation dilemma

Despite the improvements blockchains have over centrally-managed datacenters, they are not a wholesale replacement for the entire software stack. One critical use-case not supported by blockchains today are **lambdas**, automated code that can run without dedicated servers or human intervention.&#x20;

This presents a problem for decentralization because developers today are forced to fallback on centralized solutions to automate on-chain programs. A dapp is only as decentralized as its most centralized dependency! We refer to this problem as **the automation dilemma** â€“ developers today are being forced to choose between building dapps that are _automated_ or dapps that are _decentralized._

## Why Clockwork?&#x20;

We believe an open-source blockchain automation layer is necessary for the crypto industry to achieve its goal of decentralizing the world's technologies. By providing developers with public tooling and infrastructure, our mission is to support builders across the ecosystem in their mission to rewrite the Internet.&#x20;
