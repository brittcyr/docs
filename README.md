# Intro

**Clockwork** **is an open-source automation engine for** [**Solana**](https://solana.com/). Blockchain developers can use Clockwork to schedule transactions and securely automate decentralized workflows.

## **Background**

Blockchains represent a major paradigm shift in software engineering. Where traditionally an app would be hosted in a large centrally-managed datacenter, blockchains like Solana offer an alternative computing environment, maintained by a decentralized community of stakeholders. On a blockchain, program state can be efficiently copied to thousands of nodes around the world –– making information more durable and difficult to erase. And since blockchain nodes can operate collectively across many independent datacenters, they also tend to have better uptimes than individual ones!

### Solana

**Solana is the most active blockchain in the world.** Its affordable fees, low-latency messaging, and scalable architecture make it an ideal choice for users and developers. With an average of 40,000,000 non-vote transactions per day, Solana has more on-chain activity than every other notable blockchain combined. And powered by over 3,400 validators ([**source**](https://solana.com/news/validator-health-report-august-2022)), Solana is additionally one of the most decentralized blockchains in the world.

### Decentralization

**Decentralization is core to everything we do in crypto.** It's the fundamental principle behind ideas like network security, censorship resistance, and permissionless computing. Yet despite the crypto industry's emphasis on "decentralization" as being something novel, it's ironically a very old idea...

The trade-off between centralized, authoritarian decision making and decentralized, group-based coordination has been a recurring debate in philosophy, economics, politics, art, technology and history for many centuries. Despite decentralization being a core principle of the early Internet, it has become much more centralized in recent years. Today, the vast majority of internet communications flow through only a small handful of companies. Centralization generally makes internet services less secure and more susceptible to censorship. When a network admin can ban any user at will, true autonomy and asset ownership is impossible.&#x20;

This is why we work in crypto – to take advantage of some wild wizardy called **asymmetric cryptography** and build tools that help people live their lives _independent from_ and _collaboratively with_ one another.

### The automation dilemma

Despite the improvements blockchains have made over centrally-managed datacenters, they are not yet a wholesale replacement for the entire software stack. One critical use-case not supported by blockchains today are **lambdas**, automated code that can run without dedicated servers or human intervention.&#x20;

This presents a problem for decentralization because it forces developers to fallback on centralized solutions to automate on-chain programs. A dapp is only as decentralized as its most centralized dependency! We call this problem **the automation dilemma** – where a developer must choose between _automation or decentralization_ in the system they are building.

## Why Clockwork?&#x20;

We believe an open-source automation layer will be important for unlocking the next big wave of blockchain applications. By providing public tooling and infrastructure for developers, we hope to support teams of all kinds in their journeys to rewrite the rules and games of the global Internet.&#x20;
