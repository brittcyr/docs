# Introduction

**Clockwork** **is an open-source automation engine for the** [**Solana**](https://solana.com/) **blockchain**. Developers can use Clockwork to schedule transactions and securely automate decentralized workflows.

## **Background**

**Blockchains represent a major paradigm shift in software engineering.** Where traditional applications are hosted in large centrally-managed data centers, blockchains like Solana offer an alternative computing environment – one that's maintained by a decentralized community of stakeholders.&#x20;

On a blockchain, program state can be efficiently copied to thousands of nodes around the world, making information both transparent to read and durable in storage. Blockchains also efficiently distribute downtime risk across many independent data centers, generally proving to have more reliable uptime than relying on a single dedicated server!

### Solana

**Solana is the most active blockchain in the world.** Its affordable fees, low-latency messaging, and scalable architecture make it an ideal network for users and developers alike. Currently processing around [**40,000,000**](https://dune.com/kroeger0x/Solana-Metrics) transactions per day, Solana has more on-chain activity than every other notable blockchain combined. And with over [**3,400**](https://solana.com/news/validator-health-report-august-2022) validators powering the network, Solana is measurably one of the most decentralized blockchains in the world.

### Decentralization

**Decentralization is core to everything we do in crypto.** It's the fundamental principle that supports values like network security, censorship resistance, and permissionless computing.&#x20;

The funny thing is, decentralization has always __ been __ a core principle of the Internet. It has only been in recent years that this has become much less true. Today, the vast majority of Internet communications flow through just a small handful of companies. This centralization has generally made markets and services that depend on the Internet less secure and more susceptible to censorship.&#x20;

This is why we work in crypto – to build systems that help people live their lives _independently of_ and _collaboratively with_ one another. The design space is enormous and we're excited by all the things we see our friends in the space building everyday.

### The automation dilemma

Despite the innovations blockchains provide over traditional data centers, they are not a wholesale replacement for the entire application stack. One critical use-case not supported by blockchains today are **lambdas**, automated code that can run without a dedicated server.&#x20;

This creates a problem for decentralization because it means developers tend to fallback on centralized solutions in order to automate on-chain applications. A dapp is only as decentralized as its most centralized dependency! We call this problem **"the automation dilemma"** – when a developer is forced to choose between _automation_ or _decentralization_ in a system they are building.

## Why Clockwork?&#x20;

We believe an open-source blockchain automation engine is important for unlocking the next big wave of decentralized applications. By providing public tooling and developer infrastructure, we hope to support teams of all kinds in their journeys to rebuild the markets of the new global Internet.&#x20;
