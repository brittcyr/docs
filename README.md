# Introduction

**Clockwork** **is a decentralized automation network for** [**Solana**](https://solana.com/). Blockchain developers can use Clockwork to schedule transactions and automate on-chain workflows without having to rely on centralized infrastructure.&#x20;

## **Background**

Blockchains represent a major new paradigm in software development. Where applications are traditionally hosted in centrally-managed datacenters, blockchains offer an alternative hosting environment maintained by a decentralized community of stakeholders. In the distributed runtime of a blockchain, program state is redundantly copied to thousands of nodes around the world, and program execution can happen on any node in the network.&#x20;

### Solana

Solana is the most active blockchain in the world. Its affordable fees, low-latency confirmation times, and scalable architecture make it an ideal choice for new users and developers entering the crypto ecosystem today. Currently humming at over 40,000,000 non-vote transactions per day, Solana has more on-chain activity than every other notable blockchain combined. With over 3,400 full-node validators and a Nakamoto coefficient above 30 ([source](https://solana.com/news/validator-health-report-august-2022)), Solana is additionally one of the most decentralized blockchains in the world.

### Decentralization

Decentralization is core to everything we do in crypto. It's the foundational principle behind network security, censorship resistance, and permissionless computing.&#x20;

While the early internet may have been fairly decentralized, in recent years it has become much less so. The vast majority of internet communications today flow through a small handful of companies and infrastructure providers. This makes services across the internet less secure and susceptible to censorship. When a network administrator can ban any user at will, true autonomy and asset ownership is impossible.&#x20;

### The automation dilemma

Despite the improvements blockchains bring over centrally-managed datacenters, they are not a wholesale replacement for the entire application stack. One critical use-case not supported by blockchains today are lambdas: automated code that can run without human intervention.&#x20;

This presents a problem for decentralization because developers today are forced to fallback on centralized solutions to automate on-chain programs. A dapp is only as decentralized as its most centralized dependency. We refer to this problem as the "automation dilemma" **** â€“ dapp developers can either choose _automation_ or _decentralization_, but not both.&#x20;

## Why Clockwork?&#x20;

We believe an open-source, easy-to-use, decentralized automation layer is necessary for developers to build really great dapps. By providing public tooling and infrastructure, we hope to support builders across the ecosystem in their mission to create a truly decentralized internet.&#x20;
