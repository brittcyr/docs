# Intro

**Clockwork** **is an automation engine for** [**Solana**](https://solana.com/). Blockchain developers can use Clockwork to schedule transactions and securely automate decentralized workflows.

## **Background**

Blockchains represent a major paradigm shift in software engineering. Where traditionally an app would be hosted in a large centrally-managed datacenter, blockchains like Solana offer an alternative environment maintained by a decentralized community of stakeholders. On a blockchain, program state can be efficiently copied to thousands of nodes around the world –– making information more durable and difficult to erase. Since blockchain nodes typically operate across many independent datacenters, they also tend to have better uptimes than individual ones!

### Solana

**Solana is the most active blockchain in the world.** Its affordable fees, low-latency confirmation times, and scalable architecture make Solana an ideal choice for new users and developers entering the crypto ecosystem today. With around 40,000,000 non-vote transactions per day, Solana has more on-chain activity than every other notable blockchain combined. Powered by over 3,400 full-node validators ([**source**](https://solana.com/news/validator-health-report-august-2022)), Solana is additionally one of the most decentralized blockchains in the world.

### Decentralization

**Decentralization is core to everything we do in crypto.** It's the fundamental principle behind ideas like network security, censorship resistance, and permissionless computing. Despite the crypto industry's emphasis on "decentralization" as being something novel, it's ironically a very old idea. The trade-off between centralized, authoritarian decision making and decentralized, group-based coordination has been a recurring debate in philosophy, economics, politics, art, technology and history for many centuries. Decentralization was even a core principle and property of the Internet in its earliest days. Though in recent years, this has become much less true.&#x20;

Today, the vast majority of internet communications flow through a small handful of companies and infrastructure providers. This centralization generally makes services across the internet much less secure and more susceptible to censorship. When a network administrator can ban any user at will, true autonomy and asset ownership are impossible.&#x20;

This is why we work in crypto – to make use of some wild wizardy called **asymmetric cryptography** and build tools for people to be both independent _from_ and collaborative _with_ one other.

### The automation dilemma

Despite the improvements blockchains have made over centrally-managed datacenters, they are not a wholesale replacement for the entire software stack. One critical use-case not supported by blockchains today are **lambdas**, automated code that can run without dedicated servers or human intervention.&#x20;

This presents a problem for decentralization because developers today are forced to fallback on centralized solutions to automate on-chain programs. A dapp is only as decentralized as its most centralized dependency! We call this problem **the automation dilemma** – where developers are forced to choose between having either _automation_ or _decentralization._

## Why Clockwork?&#x20;

We believe an open-source automation layer will be important for unlocking the next big wave of blockchain applications. By providing public tooling and infrastructure for developers, we hope to support teams of all kinds in their journeys to rewrite the rules and games of the global Internet.&#x20;
