# Introduction

**Clockwork** **is a decentralized automation network for** [**Solana**](https://solana.com/). Blockchain developers can use Clockwork to schedule transactions and automate on-chain workflows without having to rely on centralized infrastructure.&#x20;

## **Background**

Blockchains represent a major new paradigm shift in software engineering. Where applications are traditionally hosted in large, centrally-managed, "cloud" datacenters, blockchains offer an alternative hosting environment run by a decentralized community of stakeholders. In the distributed runtime of a blockchain, program state is redundantly copied to thousands of nodes around the world, and program execution can happen on any node in the network.&#x20;

### Solana

**Solana is the most active blockchain in the world.** Its affordable fees, low-latency confirmation times, and scalable architecture make it an ideal choice for new users and developers entering the crypto ecosystem today. Currently humming at over 40,000,000 non-vote transactions per day, Solana has more on-chain activity than every other notable blockchain combined. With over 3,400 full-node validators and a Nakamoto coefficient above 30 ([**source**](https://solana.com/news/validator-health-report-august-2022)), Solana is additionally one of the most decentralized blockchains in the world.

### Decentralization

**Decentralization is core to everything we do in crypto.** It's the foundational principle behind network security, censorship resistance, and permissionless computing. Despite the crypto industry's emphasis on "decentralization" being something novel, ironically it's not a new concept at all. In fact, the trade-off between centralized, authoritarian decision making and decentralized group coordination has been a recurring theme in philosophy, economics, politics, and technology for the last few centuries.&#x20;

Decentralization was even a core value and principle of the early Internet. Though in recent years, this has become much less true. Today, the vast majority of internet communications flow through a small handful of companies and infrastructure providers. In general, this centralization makes services across the internet less secure and more susceptible to censorship. When a network administrator can ban any user at will, true user autonomy and asset ownership are impossible.&#x20;

### The automation dilemma

Despite the improvements blockchains have over centrally-managed datacenters, they are not a wholesale replacement for the entire software stack. One critical use-case not supported by blockchains today are **lambdas**: automated code that can run without dedicated servers or human intervention.&#x20;

This presents a problem for decentralization because developers today are forced to fallback on centralized solutions to automate on-chain programs. A dapp is only as decentralized as its most centralized dependency. We refer to this problem as **the automation dilemma** â€“ dapp developers today are being forced to choose between building dapps that are _automated_ or building dapps that are _decentralized._

## Why Clockwork?&#x20;

We believe an open-source, easy-to-use, decentralized automation layer is necessary for developers to build the next wave of really great dapps. By providing public tooling and infrastructure, we hope to support builders across the ecosystem in their mission to build a truly decentralized internet.&#x20;
