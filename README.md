# Introduction

**Clockwork** **is an open-source automation engine for the** [**Solana**](https://solana.com/) **blockchain**. Developers can use Clockwork to schedule transactions and automate smart-contracts without relying on centralized infrastructure.

## **Background**

**Blockchains represent a major paradigm shift in software engineering.** Where traditionally, applications are hosted in large centrally-managed data centers, blockchains like Solana offer an alternative computing environment – one that's maintained by a decentralized community of stakeholders.&#x20;

On a blockchain, information is instantly copied to thousands of nodes around the world, making it more transparent to read and durable in storage. Blockchains additionally distribute downtime risk across many independent data centers, generally proving to have more reliable uptime than relying on a single dedicated server!

### Solana

**Solana is the most active blockchain in the world.** With its affordable fees, low-latency messaging, and scalable architecture, Solana is a favorite of users and developers alike. Currently processing over [**40,000,000**](https://dune.com/kroeger0x/Solana-Metrics) transactions per day, Solana has more on-chain activity than every other notable blockchain combined. And with over [**3,400**](https://solana.com/news/validator-health-report-august-2022) validators powering the network, Solana is measurably one of the most decentralized blockchains in the world.

### Decentralization

**Decentralization is core to everything we do in crypto.** It's the fundamental principle behind network security, censorship resistance, and permissionless computing.&#x20;

The funny thing is... decentralization is not really a novel idea. It's been __ a core property of the Internet since its earliest days. However in recent years, this has become much less true. Today, the vast majority of Internet communications flow through just a small handful of companies. This centralization generally makes communication, markets, and services that depend on the Internet less secure and more vulnerable to censorship.&#x20;

This is why we work in crypto – to build systems that help people live their lives independently of and collaboratively with one another. The design space is enormous and we're tremendously inspired by the things we see our friends building everyday.

### The automation dilemma

Despite the innovations blockchains provide over traditional data centers, they are not a wholesale replacement for the entire application stack. One critical service not supported by blockchains today are **lambdas –** **automated code that can run without a dedicated server.**&#x20;

This creates a problem for decentralization because it means developers tend to fallback on centralized solutions in order to automate on-chain applications. A dapp is only as decentralized as its most centralized dependency! We call this problem **"the automation dilemma"** – whenever a developer is forced to choose between _automation_ or _decentralization_ in a system they are building.

## Why Clockwork?&#x20;

We believe an open-source, decentralized automation engine will be important for unlocking the next big wave of blockchain applications. By providing developer tooling and public infrastructure, we hope to support teams of all kinds in their journeys to rewrite the games and markets of the new global Internet.&#x20;
